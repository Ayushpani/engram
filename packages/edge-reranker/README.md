# @smaran/edge-reranker

Blazing fast, WASM-compiled Cross-Encoder Reranker for Cloudflare Workers and Edge environments.
Powered by `tract-onnx` and INT8 quantization, providing near-native inference speeds directly on the Edge.

## Features
- **Zero Cold Start**: Fits entirely in a Cloudflare Worker isolate.
- **Agentic Multi-Variate Scoring**: Not just semantic similarity. Accounts for recency (decay), profile traits, and graph centrality out of the box.
- **Pure Rust/WASM**: No C++ bindings, no `ort` dynamic linking issues.
- **Tiny Payload**: Uses INT8 quantized MS MARCO models.

## Usage

```typescript
import { EdgeReranker } from '@smaran/edge-reranker';

const reranker = new EdgeReranker();

// Call this once during your Worker initialization
// (Requires model bytes from R2 or Cache)
reranker.init(modelBytes, tokenizerBytes);

// Agentic Reranking
const results = reranker.rerankAgentic("Who is John Doe?", [
  {
    id: "mem_1",
    text: "John Doe is a software engineer.",
    created_at_ts: 1670000000,
    last_accessed_ts: 1670000000,
    is_core_profile: true,
    relation_count: 5
  }
], {
  semantic_weight: 0.8,
  profile_weight: 0.2
});

console.log(results[0].final_score);
```
